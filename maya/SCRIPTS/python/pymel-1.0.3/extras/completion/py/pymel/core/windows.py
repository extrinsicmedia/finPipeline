          axes. Values to supply are: 0 for not constraining any axis, 1 for constraing the X-axis, or 2 for constraining the
          Y-axis. When used in queries, this flag returns the latter values and these values have the same interpretation as
          above. Note: when the shift key is pressed before dragging the animation curve, the first mouse movement will instead
          determine (and override) any prior set constrained axis.                        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed

          Specifies the panel that the editor belongs to.  By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted
          panel it will belong to that panel.  If an editor doesn't belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it
          is in is deleted.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          Valid values: interactivedelayedControls how changes to animCurves are reflected in the result curves (if results are
          being shown).  If resultUpdate is interactive, then as interactive changes are being made to the animCurve, the result
          curves will be updated.  If modelUpdate is delayed (which is the default setting), then result curves are updated once
          the final change to an animCurve has been made.
    
      - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will synchronize with its own selection list.  As

      - showUpstreamCurves : suc       (bool)          [query,edit]
          If true, the dependency graph is searched upstream for all curves that drive the selected plugs (showing multiple curves
          for example in a typical driven key setup, where first the driven key curve is encountered, followed by the actual
          animation curve that drives the source object). If false, only the first curves encountered will be shown. Note that,
          even if false, multiple curves can be shown if e.g. a blendWeighted node is being used to combine multiple curves.
    
      - smoothness : s                 (unicode)       [query,edit]
          Valid values: coarseroughmediumfineSpecify the display smoothness of animation curves.

          axis, stacked vertically).
    
      - stackedCurvesMax : scx         (float)         [query,edit]
          Sets the maximum value on the per-curve value axis when in stacked mode.
    
      - stackedCurvesMin : scm         (float)         [query,edit]
          Sets the minimum value on the per-curve value axis when in stacked mode.
    
      - stackedCurvesSpace : scs       (float)         [query,edit]
          Sets the spacing between curves when in stacked mode.
    
      - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
          Query only flag.  Returns the MEL command that will edit an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
          command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
    
      - unParent : up                  (bool)          [create,edit]
          Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used with query.
    
      - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]

      - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label and option menu button
    associated with an attribute of a node. The attribute should be an integer, and this control allows a UI association of
    strings to the integers of the attribute. When a new menu item is choosen the corresponding integer will be assigned to
    the attribute. This control will automatically read the enumeration values from the attribute if none are provided.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - enumeratedItem : ei            (int, unicode)  [create]
          Enumerated item and the corresponding string. If this flag is not supplied when the control is created, then the command
          will try to read the values from the attribute.                          Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either
          as a tuple or a list.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - rowAttach : rat                (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
          Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment
          types and offsets for the entire row.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          sets the number of fields.  Only allowed values are 2 or 3.  If not specified, defaults to 3.  NOTE: if the -at flag is
          used when this widget is created, the number of children in the attribute will determine the number of fields.  Also
          note:  after creation, the number of fields cannot be changed with the -e flag.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.attrFieldGrp`
    """

    pass


def attrFieldSliderGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, float field and
    float slider (for values with a min or max specified) The group also supports the notion of a larger secondary range of
    possible field values. If an attribute is specified for this object, then it will use any min and max values defined in
    the attribute.  The user-specified values can reduce the min and max, but cannot expand them. The field created here is
    an expression field -- while normally operating as a float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the
    character -.  This will expand the field to occupy the space previously taken by the slider. The field also has an
    automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button.  The contents of this menu change depending on the state of the
    attribute being watched by the field.
    
    Flags:
      - adjustableColumn : adj         (int)           [create,edit]

          -columnAttach6 flag.  Ignored if there is not exactly six columns.
    
      - columnWidth : cw               (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Arguments are : column number, column width. Sets the width of the specified column where the first parameter specifies
          the column (1 based index) and the second parameter specifies the width.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          By default, the label of this field will be the name of the attribute.  This flag can be used to override that name with
          whatever string you want.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.

          Sets the minimum value for both the slider and the field. (by default max and min are set according to what is in the
          attribute, if anything.  If no max and min are specified, or if only one of the two are specified, then no slider is
          created.)
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.attrFieldSliderGrp`
    """

    pass


def attrNavigationControlGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged label navigation button. The group is used to
    help the user manage connections to a particular attribute. When creating the control you have the opportunity to attach
    scripts to the control that are executed on various UI events.  You can define what happens when the navigation button
    is pressed, and when a node is dragged and dropped onto this attribute. The navigation button can traverse to the
    connected node or can bring up UI to create new connections to the attribute. The button also can show you state
    information: if there already exists a connection/if the connection is ignored.
    
    Flags:

          Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

def autoLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a form layout control. A form layout allows absolute and relative positioning of the controls that
    are its immediate children. Controls have four edges: top, left, bottom and right. There are only two directions that
    children can be positioned in, right-left and up-down. The attach flags take the direction of an attachment from the
    argument that names the edge to attach (the second argument). Any or all edges of a child may be attached. There are six
    ways to attach them: Attach to Form - Attaches an edge to the relevant side of the form layout. Thus -attachForm button3
    leftwill attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an
    edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge
    of the other control named.Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side
    of another control.Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout.  The position is given as a
    fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a
    percentage of the form's size.Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will
    determine this edge's position.Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls visually. There is
    no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the form they must have at least one edge attached in
    each direction. Note:In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules: controlmust be the name of an immediate
    child of the form layout.edgemust be one of top, left, bottom, or right.positionmay range from 0 to the number of
    divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a
    measurement. This normally means 0-100 so  positionmay be thought of as a percentage.offsetis an integer value in
    pixels.These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single command. Note:More information on
    formLayouts can be found in the online User-interface Creation manual.

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

      - mainObjectList : mol           (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of every object on the active list that is the same type as the object displayed in
          the top (main) section of the channel box.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - maxHeight : mh                 (int)           [query,edit]
          An optional flag which is used to limit the height of the channelBox.

          Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the
          longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the
          longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - nodeRegex : nr                 (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which node names should (potentially) have their attributes selected for
          foreground text coloring. If nodeRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of \*' for a regular expression. The
          same idea simultaneously applies to the flag attrRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this
          regular expression will be treated as though it were case-insensitve Note: nodes in namespaces have regular expressions
          applied as though those nodes weren't in namespaces
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

          Controls the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that will be displayed for float-valued channels.
          Default is 3.  Queried, returns an int.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - selectedHistoryAttributes : sha (bool)          [query]
          Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the INPUT section of the channel box.

      - showNamespace : sn             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Controls whether or not the namespace of an object is displayed if the object is not in the root namespace.
    
      - showTransforms : st            (bool)          [query,edit]
          Controls whether this control will display transform attributes only, or all other attributes. False by default.
          Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - speed : spd                    (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Controls the speed at which the attributes are changed based on the distance the mouse has been dragged.  Common
          settings for slow/medium/fast are 0.1/1.0/10.0 respectively.  The default is 1.0.
    
      - takeFocus : tf                 (bool)          [edit]
          causes the channel box to take over the keyboard focus, if it can.
    
      - update : u                     (bool)          [edit]
          This flag can be used to force an update of the channel box display, for example after changing a display preference.
    
      - useManips : mnp                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          When you click on a field or label in the channel box, the tool switches to a manipulator that can change that value if
          you drag in the 3d view.  This flag controls the kind of manips.  Allowed values are none(self-explanatory),
          invisible(you won't see anything, but dragging in the window will adjust any of the selected attributes), and
          standard(the same as invisible, except for scale, rotate, and translate, which will be represented by their usual
          manips.)
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

def checkBox(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a check box.  A check box is a simple control containing a text label and a state of either on or
    off.  Commands can be attached to any or all of the following events:  when the check box is turned on, turned off, or
    simply when it's state is changed.
    
    Flags:
      - align : al                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          This flag is obsolete and should no longer be used. The check box label will always be left-aligned.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the check box's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the check box from inside
          the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.                    Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The edit state of the check box.  By default, this flag is set to true and the check box value may be changed by
          clicking on it.  If false then the check box is 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the check box can
          always be changed with the -v/valueflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns true|false depending upon whether the specified object exists.  Other flags are ignored.

      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          The label text. The default label is the name of the control.

          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - recomputeSize : rs             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size
          will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - value : v                      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          State of the check box.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

          Name of the clip scheduler for which to display information.                      Flag can have multiple arguments,

          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.                    Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.colorIndexSliderGrp`
    """

    pass


def colorSliderButtonGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command object creates a new color slider group with a button and a symbol
    button. This control is primarily used in the rendering UI. In this context, the button brings up a dialog that allows
    the user to assign a texture map to this parameter. Once a texture map is available, a symbol button shows up. When this
    symbol button is pressed, the user is taken to another dialog to edit the texture map.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command string executed when slider value marker is dragged.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.colorSliderButtonGrp`
    """

    pass


def colorSliderGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a color Slider group consisting of a label, a color canvas
    and a slider.  Clicking on the canvas will bring up the color editor dialog.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]

          passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

def componentBox(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a component box, which is sensitive to the active list.  It displays certain components of the last
    node on the active list, and provides a two-way connection to keep the widget up to date.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The

      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

          Immediately executes the command string once for every cell (or every selected cell, if the boolean argument is TRUE) in
          the component box, for every matching selected object (ie, for every object would be affected if you changed a cell
          value.)  Before the command is executed, #Ais substituted with the name of the attribute, and #Nwith the name of the

def connectControl(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command attaches a UI widget, specified as the first argument, to one or more dependency node attributes. The
    attributes/nodes don't have to exist yet, they will get looked up as needed. With no flag specified, this command works
    on these kinds of controls: floatField, floatScrollBar, floatSlider, intField, intScrollBar, intSlider, floatFieldGrp,
    intFieldGrp, checkBox, radioCollection, and optionMenu. With the indexflag, It will also work on the individual
    components of all other groups. This command sets up a two-way connectionbetween the control and the (first-specified)
    attribute. If this first attribute is changed in any way, the control will be appropriately updated to match its value.
    Summary: if you change the control, ALL the connected attributes change. If you change the FIRST attribute attached to
    the control, then the control will change. NOTE: the two-way connection will not be established if the attributes do not
    exist when the connectControlcommand is run. If the user later uses the control, the connection will be established at
    that time. To effectively use connectControlwith radioCollections and optionMenus, you must attach a piece of data to
    each radioButton and menuItem. This piece of data (an integer) can be attached using the dataflag in the radioButtonand
    menuItemcommands. When the button/item is selected, the attribute will be set to the value of its data. When the
    attribute is changed, the collection (or optionMenu) will switch to the item that matches the new attribute value. If no
    item matches, it will be left unchanged. There are some specialized controls that have connection capability (and more)
    built right into them. See attrFieldSliderGrp, attrFieldGrp, and attrColorSliderGrp. Using these classes can be easier
    than using connectControl.
    
    Flags:
      - fileName : fi                  (bool)          [create]
          This flag causes the connection to be treated as a filename, and the conversion from internal to external filename
          representation is made as the data is copied. This only applies to connections to Tfield controls.
    
      - index : index                  (int)           [create]
          This flag enables you to pick out a sub-control from a group that contains a number of different controls. For example,
          you can connect one field of a floatFieldGrp.  You must count each member of the group, including any text labels that
          may exist.  For example, if you have a check box group with a label, the label will count as index 1, and the first
          check box as index 2.  (Indices are 1-based)
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create]

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,

          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - control : ctl                  (bool)          [query]
          Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus.
          Caution: It is possible, at times, for an editor to exist without a control. This flag returns NONEif no control is
          present.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Attaches a tag to the Maya editor.                        Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or
          a list.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns true|false depending upon whether the specified object exists.  Other flags are ignored.
    
      - filter : f                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be placed on this editor. This filters the information coming onto the
          main list of the editor.
    
      - forceMainConnection : fmc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content.  The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in
          that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the
          -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
    
      - highlightConnection : hlc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will synchronize with its highlight list.  Not all
          editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
    
      - lockMainConnection : lck       (bool)          [create,edit]
          Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor.
          Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
    
      - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content.  The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
    
      - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the panel that the editor belongs to.  By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted
          panel it will belong to that panel.  If an editor doesn't belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it
          is in is deleted.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
    
      - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will synchronize with its own selection list.  As
          the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the change.
    
      - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
          Query only flag.  Returns the MEL command that will edit an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
          command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
    
      - unParent : up                  (bool)          [create,edit]
          Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used with query.
    
      - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic
          updates.
    
      - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.

      - addComponents : acp            (bool)          [create]
          This flag will add a frameLayout with a channel box which will display any selected components for the object.
    
      - addControl : ac                (bool)          [create]
          The first argument is the name of the attribute for which you wish to add a control. You can assume that when the editor
          is created from the template, an appropriate type of control will be used. The second string argument is optional, and
          can be used to specify a command (or script) to be executed when the attribute is changed.

      - addExtraControls : aec         (bool)          [create]
          By default, if there are attributes of a node which you do not -addControl or -suppress, then controls will be created
          automatically and appended to the end of editor created from the template. This flag allows you to specify a particular
          place in the template for such controls to be automatically inserted. If dynamic attributes have not already been
          addressed with -addControl, they will also be placed here.  A frameLayout will automatically be generated for you when
          you use this flag.
    
      - addSeparator : addSeparator    (bool)          [create]

      - beginLayout : bl               (unicode)       [create]
          Begins a layout in the template with the title specified by the string argument. Items between this flag and    its
          corresponding -endLayout flag will be contained within the layout. You can assume that when the editor is created from
          the template, an appropriate type of layout will be used. (frameLayout).
    
      - beginNoOptimize : bn           (bool)          [create]
          Specifies that the layout of items between this flag and its corresponding -endNoOptimize flag is not to be optimized to

          layout.
    
      - callCustom : ccu               (bool)          [create]
          Specifies that at this point in the template when building the dialog, the procedure specified by the first argument is
          to be called to create some UI objects when a new node type is edited. The procedure specified by the second argument is
          to be called if an attribute editor already exists and another node of the same type is now to be edited. The replacing
          procedure should connect any controls created by the creating procedure to the equivalent attributes in the new node. A
          list of zero or more attributes specifies the attributes which the two procedures will involve. The procedures should
          have the signature: proc AEcustomNew(string attributeName1, string attributeName2) The number of attributes specified in
          the call should correspond to the number of attributes in the procedure signature.
    
      - collapse : cl                  (bool)          [create]
          This flag is only valid when used in conjunction with a -bl/beginLayout flag.  It is used to specify the initial
          expand/collapse state of the layout.  A true value will cause the layout to be collapsed upon creation, while a false
          value will expand the layout.  The default is true (ie. collapsed).

      - dimControl : dc                (unicode, unicode, bool) [create]
          This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is
          the node name and the second is the attribute whose control you wish to affect.  The third argument is a boolean which
          specifies whether to dim (true) or undim (false) the associated control.
    
      - endLayout : el                 (bool)          [create]

          Ends a scrollLayout.
    
      - extraControlsLabel : ecl       (unicode)       [create]
          By default the label is Extra Attributes. Specify an alternate label or an empty string to hide the label. This flag
          must be used in conjuction with the -aec/addExtraControls flag.
    
      - interruptOptimize : io         (bool)          [create]
          Enforces a division between two sets of items whose layouts may be optimized.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create]
          This flag can only be used with the -addControl or the -addDynamicControl flags.  And it must be specified FIRST. The
          string will override the name of the attribute that will be displayed in the attribute editor.
    
      - listExtraAttributes : lea      (unicode)       [create]
          List extra attributes.This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).
          The first argument is the node name.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
          Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - queryControl : qc              (unicode, unicode) [create]
          This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is
          the node name and the second is the attribute whose control you wish to query.  Note that in most cases, using this flag
          is identical to issuing a getAttr command, however, in the case of textFields (e.g. for message attributes), the text
          value currently being displayed will be returned, NOT the actual attribute value.
    
      - queryLabel : ql                (unicode, unicode) [create]
          This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is
          the node name and the second is the attribute whose control label you wish to query.  In most cases this flag returns
          the same value as the attribute's nice name, but when a -label flag was present on the -addControl command that created
          the control, -queryLabel will return that value instead
    
      - suppress : s                   (unicode)       [create]
          Prevent a control for the attribute specified by the string argument from appearing in the editor created from the

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

          Command executed when the field changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/valueflag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when dragging in the field.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.floatField`
    """

    pass


def floatFieldGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text and editable float
    fields.  The label text is optional and one to four float fields can be created.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]

      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

    Create a scroll bar control that accepts only float values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  The scroll bar
    displays a marker indicating the current value of the scroll bar relative to it's minimum and maximum values.  Click and

    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the scroll bar's value marker.                        Flag can have
          multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard

def floatSlider2(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a float slider containing two handles. The two handles are arranged such that they cannot pass one
    another, thus handle 1 will always have a value less than or or equal to handle 2 when you adjust the values. Each
    handle may have a MEL command associated with it which is issued when the handle moves and thus can be used to update
    the values of plugs such as via a setAttr command. Each handle can also be associated with a float textfield to display
    the current value of the handle. Note: the floatSlider2 widget currently only supports vertical (columnLayout)
    orientation.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand1 : cc1           (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Command to be associated with handle 1 and issued whenever the value of the handle is changed (except when values are
          changed via the -hv/handleValue flag). An example command might be setAttr nurbsSphere1.txand if handle 1 were to move
          to value 0.23 the slider would issue the command setAttr nurbsSphere1.tx 0.23;.
    
      - changeCommand2 : cc2           (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Command to be associated with handle 2 and issued whenever the value of the handle is changed (except when values are
          changed via the -hv/handleValue flag). An example command might be setAttr nurbsSphere1.txand if handle 2 were to move
          to value 0.23 the slider would issue the command setAttr nurbsSphere1.tx 0.23;.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns true|false depending upon whether the specified object exists.  Other flags are ignored.

      - polarity : pol                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the polarity of the slider. If 0 (the default), the minimum value (specified by the -minimum flag) occurs at
          the bottom end of the slider and maximum at the top(right), with values increasing as the slider handles are moved
          towards the upper end of the slider. If the polarity is specified as 1, the reverse behaviour occurs, with the maximum
          occurring at the bottom end, the mimimum occuring at the top(right) end and values decreasing as the handles are moved
          towards the upper end.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - positionControl1 : pc1         (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Set the name of the control (if any) which is associated with handle 1 of this slider. The control must be a floatField.
          The control always displays the value of the handle, and is updated as the handle moves.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.floatSliderButtonGrp`
    """

    pass


def floatSliderGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
    text, an float field and a float slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field range
    values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you to
    enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.  To
    do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the
    command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will
    result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command:
    floatSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to
    select any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.
    If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the
    slider as well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits
    will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to
    the field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160.

          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]

          passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

    leftwill attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an
    edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge
    of the other control named.Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side
    of another control.Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout.  The position is given as a
    fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a
    percentage of the form's size.Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will
    determine this edge's position.Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls visually. There is
    no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the form they must have at least one edge attached in
    each direction. Note:In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules: controlmust be the name of an immediate
    child of the form layout.edgemust be one of top, left, bottom, or right.positionmay range from 0 to the number of
    divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a
    measurement. This normally means 0-100 so  positionmay be thought of as a percentage.offsetis an integer value in
    pixels.These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single command. Note:More information on
    formLayouts can be found in the online User-interface Creation manual.

          Arguments are: control, edge, offset. Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to the opposite
          side of the form.
    
      - attachPosition : ap            (unicode, unicode, int, int) [create,edit]
          Arguments are: control, edge, offset, position Valid edge values are: top| bottom| left| right. Attach a control to a
          position in the form.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.

      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Define how updates are dispatched during interactive editing of the ramp widget. True causes updates to only dispatch
          after releasing the mouse button after editing. False (the default) causes updates to dispatch interactively during
          editing (e.g. while moving ramp curve points). Note that the global update mode, if set to on releasecan disable the
          effect of this option.

    This layout arranges children in a grid fashion where every cell in the grid is the same size.  You may specify the
    number of rows and columns as well as the width and height of the grid cells.
    
    Flags:
      - allowEmptyCells : aec          (bool)          [create,query]
          Specify true if you want free positioning of the children in the layout and potentially leaving empty cells between
          children. Set to false if you want the children to always be packed together. The default is true.
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - autoGrow : ag                  (bool)          [create,query]
          Specify true if you want the grid layout size to grow as children are added.  For example, if the grid layout has 2
          columns and 2 rows then adding a fifth child will cause the grid to expand to 3 rows if this flag is true, otherwise the
          grid will remain the same size and the new child will be hidden from view until you expand the size of the grid using
          the appropriate flags.  The default is true.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - cellHeight : ch                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          A positive non-zero integer value indicating the height of cells in the grid layout.
    
      - cellWidth : cw                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
          A positive non-zero integer value indicating the width of cells in the grid layout.
    
      - cellWidthHeight : cwh          (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Two positive non-zero integer values for indicating the width and height, respectively, of the cells in the grid layout.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - columnsResizable : cr          (bool)          [create,query]
          Specify true if you want the number of columns to adjust according to the width of the layout.  Set to false if you want
          the number of columns to remain fixed when the width of the layout is changed.  The default is false.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns true|false depending upon whether the specified object exists.  Other flags are ignored.

      - gridOrder : go                 (bool)          [query]
          As opposed to the childArray flag, the gridOrder flag returns the children of the grid Layout in the order they are
          diplayed in the window.

          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

      - numberOfRowsColumns : nrc      (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Two positive non-zero integer values for the number of rows and columns, respectively, in the grid layout.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
          The parent layout for this control.
    
      - popupMenuArray : pma           (bool)          [query]
          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - position : pos                 (unicode, int)  [create,edit]
          Specify the name of a child control in the grid layout along with a 1-based integer value indicating the desired
          position of the child.  Positions increase from left to right within a row and then wrap around to the next row
          increasing from top to bottom.  For example, a grid layout with 3 columns and 2 rows has 6 visible positions where 1, 2
          and 3 occupy the first row and 4, 5 and 6 occupy the second.                     Flag can have multiple arguments,
          passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
      - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

      - block : b                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column
          of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable. The number of blocks that will be
          visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the
          window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need. The resultant output string of each HUD is
          formatted within each block, using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding,
          labelWidth and dataWidth). The layout is shown in the following diagram: __________________________________________ |
          |     |        |         |     |     | |  P  |  J  |   LW   |   DWX   |  J  |  P  |
          |_____|_____|________|_________|_____|_____| P = Sub-block of width, padding J = Justification of the entire block LW =
          Sub-block of width, labelWidth DWX = X number of sub-blocks of width, dataWidth, for X data elements. Block LayoutThe
          above diagram shows the layout of each block. The widths: padding, labelWidth and dataWidth are defined by their
          respective flags. To elaborate on the layout of the blocks, First the padding of the block is calculated. Then the two
          main sub-blocks (LW and DWX) in the above diagram, are justified and positioned together between the left and right
          margins of the block. The widths of the main sub-blocks are not variable based on it's contents. The only sub-block in
          the above diagram which is unique is the DWX sub-block which actually represents X number of sub-blocks, where X is the
          number of data elements returned by the command. Block PositioningBlocks on the top section begin from the top edge of
          the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility
          from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport. Lastly, there can
          be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error.
          Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
    
      - blockAlignment : ba            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          Specifies the procedure or script to run, in order to obtain the desired information. This must return a value or an
          array of values. A warning will be displayed if the command does not return a value. This flag MUST always be
          accompanied by a trigger flag (eg. a condition flag, an event flag, an attachToRefresh flag, etc.).
    
      - conditionChange : cc           (unicode)       [create,edit]
          A trigger which runs the command (to sample the data), when the named condition changes. The named condition must be
          pre-defined or a user defined boolean. To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -lc/listConditions flag.
    
      - conditionFalse : cf            (unicode)       [create,edit]
          A trigger which runs the command (to sample the data), when the named condition becomes false. The named condition must
          be pre-defined or a user defined boolean. To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -lc/listConditions flag.

      - connectionChange : con         (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Runs the command when the named attribute changes its connectivity. The string must identify both the dependency node
          and the particular attribute. If the dependency node is deleted, this HUD is removed (even if the deletion is undoable).
    
      - dataAlignment : da             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the alignment of the data blocks and the data text, within a HUD block. Available alignments are: leftand
          right. The default alignment is left.
    
      - dataFontSize : dfs             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Sets the font size of the returned data. Available sizes are: small and large.
    
      - dataWidth : dw                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the pixel width of the virtual textboxwhich will hold a data value. For commands which return more than one
          value (ie. arrays), one of these textboxeswill be created for each data element, each with this specified width. If the
          width of the data value exceeds the width of the textbox, the data value will be truncated to fit within the dimensions
          of the textbox.(To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
    
      - decimalPrecision : dp          (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are
          1 to 8.
    
      - disregardIndex : di            (bool)          [create,edit]
          This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag. If it is specified, and the HUD is attached
          to a multi (indexed) attribute, then the HUD command will run no matter which attribute in the multi changes.
    
      - event : ev                     (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Runs the command when the named event occurs. The named event, must be a pre-defined Maya event. To get a list of what
          events exist, use the -le/listEvents flag.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag returns whether the given object exists in the Heads-Up Display layout. An object name must be supplied with
          this command. This flag cannot be combined with any other flag.
    
      - getOption : op                 (unicode)       [query]
          This flag will return the value of the option specified by the string. See setOption for a list of options Flag can have
          multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - gridColor : gco                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          This flag specifies a color for the grid lines using the inactive color palette. Specifying an index number between 1 to
          23 will select the corresponding color in the palette.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Text string that appears to the left of the desired information.
    
      - labelFontSize : lfs            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Sets the font size of the label. Available sizes are: small and large.
    
      - labelWidth : lw                (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the pixel width of the virtual textboxwhich will hold the label. The contents of this textboxwill be left
          justified. If the width of the actual label exceeds the width of the textbox,the label will be truncated to fit within
          the dimensions of the textbox.(To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
    
      - lastOccupiedBlock : lob        (int)           [create]
          Returns the block number of the last occupied block in a given section.
    
      - layoutVisibility : lv          (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the visibility of Heads-Up Display layout on and off. This does not modify individual visibilities of heads-up
          displays, but turns off the layout so that no heads-up displays will draw to screen. Personalized settings for the
          visibilities of HUDs are kept safe. This flag can only be used by itself, excepting edit and query.
    
      - listConditions : lc            (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available conditions.
    
      - listEvents : le                (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available events.
    
      - listHeadsUpDisplays : lh       (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of existing HUDs.
    
      - listNodeChanges : lnc          (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available node changes.
    
      - listPresets : lp               (bool)          [create,query]
          This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available preset HUDs.
    
      - name : n                       (unicode)       [edit]
          This flag only permits the EDITING of the name of the Heads-Up Display.
    
      - nextFreeBlock : nfb            (int)           [create]
          Returns the block number of the next free block in a given section.
    
      - nodeChanges : nc               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Works only with selection based triggers (ie. SelectionChangedor SomethingSelected), otherwise this flag is ignored.
          This flag attaches the HUD script to execute on specific node changes of any selected node. This flag is used to set a
          nodeChange. In order to reset a nodeChange, use the -rnc/resetNodeChanges flag. To view a list of all available node
          changes, use the -lnc/listNodeChanges flag. The following is a list of available node changes and their function:
          attributeChange:  The script will be sensitive to any attribute changes in the currently                   selected
          nodes. connectionChange: The script will be sensitive to any connection changes in the currently
          selected nodes. instanceChange:   The script will be sensitive to any changes to an instance in the
          currently selected nodes. On query mode, this flag will return the values of all nodeChanges in pairs of values (the
          name of the nodeChange followed by its value). WARNING: (Performance Warning)          Attaching a nodeChange trigger to
          a selection based trigger can cause a large          performance drop, if the node change that is being watched is
          caused by the          HUD script itself. With this said, an attempt should be made to keep the HUD command/script
          simple and limited to retrieving data. Changing an attribute, creating or                  modifying a connection or
          instance will all result in a performance drop.
    
      - padding : p                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.
    
      - preset : pre                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          This setting is used to select certain pre-defined HUDs, some of which retrieve specific data, that is unobtainable
          through normal MEL commands or scripts. This flag is mutually exclusive from the command and trigger flag combination.
          However, presets can work with all other headsUpDisplay attribute flags (ie. block alignment, label, dataFontSize,
          etc.), unless otherwise specified below. To obtain a list of available presets, use the -lp/listPresets flag on this
          command. The following is a list of available presets and a description of each: cameraNamesThis will return the camera
          name that the view is looking through, in the data block, for each view that the HUD is drawing to.polyVertsThis will
          return three values in the data block, regarding the number of vertices that are visible by the camera. 1st Value:
          Represents the number of camera visible vertices, both active and inactive.2nd Value: Represents the number of camera
          visible vertices, on active objects only.3rd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, that are
          active.polyEdgesThis will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of edges that are visible by the
          camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset.polyFacesThis will return three values in
          the data block, regarding the number of faces that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are
          similar to the polyVerts preset.polyUVsThis will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of UVs that
          are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset.polyTrianglesThis will
          return three values in the data block, regarding the number of triangles that are visible by the camera. The order of
          these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset.frameRateThis will return a single string carrying both the frame
          rate and the fpsstring in the data block. It updates on each refresh.viewAxisThis will draw the orientation of the grid
          axes within the HUD. It updates on each refresh. While this preset can take in all attribute flags, the only one which
          will have an effect are block attribute related flags (ie. block alignment and block size). The block dimensions of this
          preset are: blockSize - largeand blockWidth - 50, which results in a 50x50 pixel region.distanceFromCameraThis will
          return in the data block the distance from the view's camera to the centre of the bounding box containing the selected
          objects in the view.
    
      - refresh : r                    (bool)          [create]
          This flag forces the given Heads-Up Display element to refresh, updating the value displayed.  This flag cannot be
          combined with any other flag.
    
      - remove : rem                   (bool)          [create,edit]
          This command will remove a given HUD object, given a specified HUD name. This flag will override all other flags and is
          mutually exclusive from the other remove flags.
    
      - removeID : rid                 (int)           [create,edit]
          This command will remove a given HUD object, given a specified HUD ID number assigned to it at creation time. This flag
          will override all other flags and is mutually exclusive from the other remove flags.
    
      - removePosition : rp            (int, int)      [create,edit]
          This command will remove the contents of a specific block location in the HUD layout. This flag will override all other
          flags and is mutually exclusive from the other remove flags. Syntax for this flag is: -removePosition/rp [section]
          [block].
    
      - resetNodeChanges : rnc         (unicode)       [edit]
          This flag will reset a specificied nodeChange back to false. This flag only operates under the edit flag. See the
          description for the -nc/nodeChanges flag for further details.
    
      - scriptResult : sr              (bool)          [query]
          This flag is only used in conjunction with the query flag. Calling a query on this flag returns the most recent result
          of the HUD.
    
      - section : s                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows
          make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.
          ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |
          |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |
          |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____|Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated
          above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent
          HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility
          precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen
          space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically
          compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is
          issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each
          row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority,
          followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly
          Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well.
          The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two
          sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where
          sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and
          finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.
    
      - setOption : so                 (unicode, unicode) [edit]

          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    operations performed by this command are limited to HUDs that are button controls. The only mandatory flags, on creation
    are the section and block flags. Like the headsUpDisplay command, upon creation of a HUD button, an ID number will be
    assigned to it. This can be used to remove the HUD via the headsUpDisplay command (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if

          Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column
          of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable. The number of blocks that will be
          visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the
          window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need. For HUD buttons, the format differs from
          that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify,
          padding, buttonWidth) is shown below: __________________________________ |     |     |          |     |     | |  P  |  J

          entire block Button = Sub-block of width, buttonWidth Block PositioningBlocks on the top section begin from the top edge
          of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from
          visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport. Lastly,

      - section : s                    (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows
          make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.

          |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____|Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated
          above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1 To prevent
          HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility
          precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen
          space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically
          compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is
          issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains. For each
          row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority,
          followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly
          Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well.
          The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two
          sections are of lowest priority. This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where
          sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and
          finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.

def hudSlider(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) slider control which is placed in a 2D inactive overlay plane on the 3D
    viewport. It is to be used to provide hands-on interaction designated by a user script. The HUD slider is derived from a
    generic HUD object and thus inherits a similar workflow. Although this command provides much of the same functionality
    as the headsUpDisplay command, it does not provide headsUpDisplay layout controls such as layoutVisibility,
    nextFreeBlock, lastOccupiedBlock, exists, remove, etc. To access that functionality, please use the headsUpDisplay
    command. This command is focused solely around the creation and management of HUD sliders. Similarly, all operations
    performed by this command are limited to HUDs that are sliders. The only mandatory flags, on creation are the section
    and block flags. Like the headsUpDisplay command, upon creation of a HUD slider, an ID number will be assigned to it.
    This can be used to remove the HUD slider via the headsUpDisplay command (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if desired.
    Alternatively, the headsUpDisplay command can remove HUD objects via their position (section and block), or their unique
    name.
    
    Flags:
      - allowOverlap : ao              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag
          description for more details).
    
      - block : b                      (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column
          of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable. The number of blocks that will be
          visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the
          window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need. For HUD sliders, the format differs from
          that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify,
          padding, labelWidth, valueWidth) is shown below: __________________________________________________________________ |

          the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility
          from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport. Lastly, there can
          be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error.
          Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
    
      - blockAlignment : ba            (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

def hyperGraph(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The following is an overview of the basic features of the hypergraph. A more detailed description is given in the user
    manuals. The hypergraph provides the user with the ability to view and edit the maya scene graph.  The hypergraph
    supports two types of graphs: the DAG or scene hierarchy and the dependency graph. The default view of the hypergraph
    editor is the DAG view. The user can show the dependency graph for a collection of nodes by first selecting the nodes
    and navigating to the dependency graph using one of the graph options.  The user can save any view by setting a bookmark
    to that view.  The user can also show previous views using the view options provided. The hypergraph supports a simple
    editing mechanism for editing hierarchy in the DAG view and connections in dependency graph view. In the DAG  view, the
    user can reparent or reorder nodes in the graph using drag-and-drop. In the dependency graph view, the user can select
    connections and delete them or make new connections by dragging and dropping nodes or existing connections. The
    hypergraph supports two layout modes in the DAG view: automatic and freeform.  In automatic mode, the graph nodes are
    automatically positioned according to the layout preferences.  In freeform mode, the user can position nodes manually.
    The node position is saved in the scene. A background image can be placed behind DG or DAG in freeform mode. This can be
    used as a template for positioning nodes in a user-defined layout. Nodes in the DAG view can be expanded or collapsed.
    The state is saved in the scene.  The performance of the graph drawing will increase as hierarchies are collapsed. In
    addition to hierachy relationships, the hypergraph can show expression, constraint and deformation relationships in the
    DAG. These can be enabled/disabled through the options provided.  There are also additional filters for showing shape
    nodes and invisible nodes.  The amount of detail show may affect the speed of the display of the graph. Most of the UI
    features of the hypergraph are addressable through the hypergraph command-line interface.  The available command-line
    options are described in the next section.

          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - doubleClickCommand : dcc       (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control is double clicked.
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Flags:
      - align : al                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          The label alignment.  Alignment values are left, right, and center. By default, the label is aligned center. Currently

          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the
          callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
    
      - collection : cl                (unicode)       [create]
          To explicitly add the control to the specified collection.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disabledImage : di             (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/imageflag. This is
          a Windows only flag.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - dropRectCallback : drc         (callable)      [edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site.  It returns the shape of
          the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y) The return value is an
          array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn,
          followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.                     Flag can
          have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

    Create a field control that accepts only integer values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  An invisible
    slider is attached to the field and accessed by holding down the Ctrl modifier key while pressing one of the mouse
    buttons.  Dragging the invisible slider to the right with the middle mouse button increases the field value by the
    amount specified with the -s/stepflag, while dragging to the left decreases the value by the same amount.  The left and
    right mouse buttons apply a factor of 0.1 and 10 to the step value.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the invisible slider.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of

          The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.
          If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The value of the field can always be changed with the
          -v/valueflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Command executed when the value changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.                    Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.intSlider`
    """

    pass


def intSliderGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
    text, an integer field and an integer slider. The text and field controls are optional.  Editing or querying the field
    range values has no effect if the -f/fieldflag was not specified when the group was created. This group also allows you
    to enter values into the field outside of the slider range which is limited by the -min/minValueand -max/maxValueflags.
    To do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValueand -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags to specify a greater range of values. Note that the
    command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValuegreater than the -min/minValuevalue nor a
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueless than the -max/maxValuevalue. If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValueand
    -fmx/fieldMaxValueflags then you will notice that entering a value in the field that is outside of the slider range will
    result in extending the slider range as well.  For example, if you create a slider group with the following command:
    intSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100; Then you will be able to use the slider to select
    any value from -10 to 10. At the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to 100.  If you
    enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such that this value is now accessible through the slider as
    well.  In fact, the new slider limit will become double of that what you entered.  Note that the slider limits will
    never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the
    field limit of 100 and not doubled to 160. TelfBaseGrpCmd.cpp

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dragCommand : dc               (callable)      [create,edit]
          The command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the

      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.                   Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).

          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.

def menuEditor(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    A menuEditor displays the contents of a popup menu and allows the menu's items to be edited. Menu items are represented
    by labelled icons which can be dragged around within the editor to change the menu's layout.  Various objects can be
    dragged and dropped into the menuEditor to create new menu items: toolButtons from the shelf or toolbox, shelfButtons
    from the shelf, iconTextButtons with attached commands, and scripts from the command window. When editing a Marking
    Menu, the radial menu items correspond to 8 icons arranged in a circle within the menuEditor.  Overflow items in the
    Marking Menu (or linear items in a normal menu) are displayed in a column below the radial items. To edit a submenu of a
    popup menu, a new menuEditor instance must be created (typically within its own window) and attached to its parent
    menuEditor. Some flags require the position of a menu item to be passed in as an argument.  For these, positions are
    specified with a (string,int) pair, where the string corresponds to a radial position (possibily None) and the int
    corresponds to a linear position (possibly equal to 0 for none).  Radial positions are specified by one of (N,0),
    (NE,0), (E,0), (SE,0), (S,0), (SW,0), (W,0) or (NW,0).  Overflow, or linear positions, are specified with (None,i),
    where i is a 1-based index giving the position of the item within the overflow column.Note:This command in not meant to
    be called explicitly. It was created to support the Marking Menu editor. It is recommended that you use that editor to
    modify marking menus.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - cellHeight : ch                (int)           [query,edit]
          The height of the icons in the menuEditor.

          The width and height of the icons in the menuEditor.
    
      - checkBoxPresent : cbp          (bool, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          This controls whether a menu item has a check box or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by the
          position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If queried, an array of booleans is
          returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ...
          NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - checkBoxState : cbs            (bool, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          The state of the check box associated with a menu item. The arguments are a flag indicating state, followed by the
          position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have a check box. If queried, an array of
          booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
          NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - command : c                    (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          The command or script executed by a menu item. The arguments are the command string or script name, followed by the
          position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item or a separator item. If queried, an
          array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items
          (in order, N, NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - delete : d                     (unicode, int)  [edit]
          Deletes the menu item at the given position, removing it from the menu.  If the menu item has a submenu, and a sub-
          menuEditor is open and attached to it, then the sub-menuEditor's window and all its child menuEditor windows will be
          closed recursively.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns true|false depending upon whether the specified object exists.  Other flags are ignored.
    
      - fullPathName : fpn             (bool)          [query]
          Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents
    
      - height : h                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
      - iconMenuCallback : imc         (unicode)       [create]
          This is the name of a MEL callback procedure that is called to create the popup menus attached to icons in the
          menuEditor.  The callback is called once for each newly created icon, and once each time an icon is moved within the
          menuEditor.  Popup menus created by the callback should contain commands for editing the menu item associated with the
          icon.  Operations accessible through the menu should include deletion of the item, editing of the item's
          label/command/image/checkbox/optionbox, creation of a submenu, and popping up a sub-menuEditor. The arguments to the
          callback must match this form: callbackProc(string $menuEditorName, string $parentIconName, string $menuTitle, string
          $radialPosition, int $overflowRow); The popup menu's parent should be $parentIconName. Note that when a sub-menuEditor
          is created, this flag need not be re-specified as it adopts a default value equal to the value of its parent
          menuEditor's -imc/iconMenuCallback flag.
    
      - image : i                      (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          The filename of the icon associated with a menu item. This icon is displayed by the menuEditor to represent the menu
          item. The arguments are the icon filename, followed by the position of the menu item. If queried, an array of strings is
          returned containing all the icon filenames. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
          NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.
    
      - label : l                      (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          The label of a menu item. The arguments are the label text, followed by the position of the menu item. If queried, an
          array of strings is returned containing all the labels. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in
          order, N, NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - manage : m                     (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All
          controls are created managed by default.
    
      - menuItemTypes : mit            (bool)          [query]
          This is a query only flag.  Returns an array of strings indicating the type of contents in each cell of the menuEditor.
          Cells can be vacant, or may contain a regular menu item, or a separator, or a submenuitem.  In each case, the
          corresponding string is returned. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ... NW),
          and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - numberOfPopupMenus : npm       (bool)          [query]
          Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - optionBoxCommand : obc         (unicode, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          The command or script executed by a menu item's associated option box item. The arguments are the command string or
          script name, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have an
          associated option box item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries
          of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or
          linear) menu items.
    
      - optionBoxPresent : obp         (bool, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          This controls whether a menu item has an associated option box item or not. The arguments are a flag indicating
          presence, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If
          queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to
          radial items (in order, N, NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]

      - radioButtonPresent : rbp       (bool, unicode, int) [query,edit]
          This controls whether a menu item has a radio button or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by
          the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If queried, an array of booleans
          is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N, NE, ...
          NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

          The state of the radio button associated with a menu item. The arguments are a flag indicating state, followed by the
          position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have a radio button. If queried, an array of
          booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
          NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

          Creates a submenu item at the given position.  A submenu item created within the radial portion of a menu will overwrite
          whatever item (if any) is currently at the given position. A submenu item created within the overflow (linear) portion
          of a menu will be inserted before the item currently at the given position.
    
      - subMenuEditorWindow : sew      (unicode)       [create]
          The name of the window which contains a sub-menuEditor.  Only use when creatitg a sub-menuEditor. This window will

      - subMenuEditorsOpen : seo       (bool)          [query]
          This is a query only flag.  Returns an array of booleans, each of which indicates if a sub-menuEditor is open and
          attached to the menu item in a particular cell.  One boolean is returned for each cell in the menuEditor, even if the
          cell is vacant or contains a non-submenu item (false will be returned in both these cases).  Only when a cell contains a
          submenu item can true possibily be returned. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, N,
          NE, ... NW), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.                         Flag can have
          multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

          an item) will be immediately reflected in this menu. This flag is ignored if the editor is a sub-menuEditor.  The editor
          will update gracefully if the value of the flag is changed from its initial value.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

      - subMenu : sm                   (bool)          [create,query]
          Indicates that the item will have a submenu. Subsequent menuItems will be added to the submenu until setParent -menuis
          called.  Note that a submenu item creates a menu object and consequently the menucommand may be used on the submenu
          item.
    
      - tearOff : to                   (bool)          [create]

          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - maxConstantTransparency : mct  (float)         [query,edit]
          Sets the maximum constant transparency.  Setting this value remaps constant transparency values from the range [0.0,
          1.0] to the range [0.0, maxConstantTransparency]. All transparency values are shifted linearly to the new range, so a
          fully transparency object (transparency 1.0) would appear with a transparency of maxConstantTransparency in the
          viewport, allowing highly transparent objects to be made visible.  This flag only affects constant (non-textured)
          transparent objects.

          created via the API (i.e. the flag would be used on the derived MPxModelEditorCommand), though the flag may also be used
          on the base modelEditor command to restore a default Maya model editor to the panel. Note that the model editor
          previously owned by the panel is deleted.

          clamped to the OpenGL size.  If many large textures are used in a scene reducing this value improves performance.  On
          Impact texture memory is pinned in RAM so using large textures can cause reliability and performance problems. Again
          reducing this value will help. Software rendering does not use this value. This flag is obsolete as of Maya 6.5. The

          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          This command is executed when the field text is changed by the user.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Flags:
      - addFavorite : af               (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Add an item path to the favorites folder.  The item path does not have to actually be in the tree.
    
      - addItem : add                  (unicode, unicode, callable) [create,edit]
          Add an item to the control.  The arguments are item-path,icon path,command where item-path is the path from the root of
          the tree to the item's name icon path is the icon displayed in the results list command is the script which is executed
          when the item is LMB clicked
    
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - clearContents : clr            (bool)          [edit]
          Clears the contents of the control.
    
      - collapsePath : cp              (unicode)       [edit]
          Collapse a path in the tree.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - executeItem : ei               (unicode)       [edit]
          Execute the command associated with an item.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]

      - favoriteState : fst            (unicode)       [query]
          Returns the favorite state of the passed item path: 0 = it's a path to an item which has no favorite. 1 = it's a path to
          an item which has a favorite. 2 = it's a path to a favorite. 3 = it's a path which doesn't exist, but for which there is
          a favorite.
    
      - favoritesCallback : fcb        (callable)      [create,edit]
          This script is called whenever a favorite is added or removed. It is passed two arguments: The item's path and a boolean
          indicating if it is being added to favorites (True) or removed (False).

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.optionMenu`
    """

    pass


def optionMenuGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, option menu and an
    extra label.  Both the label and extra label are optional. Subsequent calls to the menuItem command will place them in
    the option menu.  When adding menu items to the option menu after the initialization step, use the name of the options
    menu itself. See the example below for more details. Note that commands attached to menu items will not get called. Use
    the -cc/changedCommandflag to be notified when the user changes the value of the option menu.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.
    
      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create]
          Returns true|false depending upon whether the specified object exists.  Other flags are ignored.

          The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's

def outlinerEditor(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates an outliner editor which can be used to display a list of objects.WARNING: some flag combinations
    may not behave as you expect.  The command is really intended for internal use for creating the outliner used by the
    various editors.
    
    Flags:
      - allowMultiSelection : ams      (bool)          [create,edit]
          If true then multiple selection will be allowed in the outliner.
    
      - alwaysToggleSelect : ats       (bool)          [create,edit]
          If true, then clicking on an item in the outliner will select or deselect it without affecting the selection of other

          Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus.
          Caution: It is possible, at times, for an editor to exist without a control. This flag returns NONEif no control is
          present.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

          as the current template.
    
      - directSelect : ds              (bool)          [create,edit]
          If true then clicking on an item in the outliner will add or remove just that item from the selection connection.  If
          false then clicking on an item in the outliner causes the selection connection to be reloaded with the currently
          selected items in the outliner.
    
      - displayMode : dm               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Affects how the outliner displays when a filter is applied.  List mode is a non-indented flat list.  DAG mode indents to

      - forceMainConnection : fmc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content.  The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in
          that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the
          -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
    
      - highlightActive : ha           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are active Note: if the outliner is

      - isChildSelected : ics          (PyNode)        [query]
          This flag allows you to query if one or more of the children of the specified item is selected in the outliner. The item
          should be specified using a unique DAG path. Note that if the specified item appears multiple times in the outliner, the
          result will be true if one or more children of any occurrence of the specified item in the outliner is/are selected.
    
      - lockMainConnection : lck       (bool)          [create,edit]
          Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor.

      - longNames : ln                 (bool)          [query,edit]
          Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface.  Note that this flag is ignored if the
          -niceNames flag is set.  Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - mainListConnection : mlc       (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content.  The editor will
          only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.

          This flag is the name of an outliner that this outliner will share the objects and state from. When an outliner is
          shared, all of its state information comes from, and is applied to, the master outliner.
    
      - niceNames : nn                 (bool)          [query,edit]
          Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the
          longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the
          longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
    
      - object : obj                   (PyNode)        [query]
          This flags is used together with the parentObjectflag to get the name of the parent object for the specified object.

          belongs to: eg:  Layer1 Attr1 Attr2 Layer2 Attr1  If it is false then the outliner will be organized primarily by
          attributes. eg:  Attr1 Layer1 Layer2 Attr2 Layer1
    
      - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]

          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will synchronize with its own selection list.  As
          the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the change.

          in a typical driven key setup, where first the driven key curve is encountered, followed by the actual animation curve
          that drives the source object). If false, only the first curves encountered will be shown. Note that, even if false,
          multiple curves can be shown if e.g. a blendWeighted node is being used to combine multiple curves.

          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of

    Hit ESC to Cancellabel for interruptable operations. Only one progress window is allowed on screen at a time. While the
    window is visible, the busy cursor is shown.
    
    Flags:
      - endProgress : ep               (bool)          [create]
          Terminates the progress window. No other flags can be used at the same time. This is normally issued through MEL in
          response to the -ic/isCancelled flag being set or if the progress value reaches its maximum.
          Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - isCancelled : ic               (bool)          [query]
          Returns true if the user has tried to cancel the operation. Returns false otherwise.
    
      - isInterruptable : ii           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Returns true if the progress window should respond to attempts to cancel the operation. The cancel button is disabled if
          this is set to true.
    
      - maxValue : max                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The maximum or endingvalue of the progress indicator. If the progress value is greater than the -max/maxValue, the
          progress value will be set to the maximum. Default value is 100.
    
      - minValue : min                 (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The minimum or startingvalue of the progress indicator. If the progress value is less than the -min/minValue, the
          progress value will be set to the minimum. Default value is 0.
    
      - progress : pr                  (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The amount of progress currently shown on the control. The value will always be between min and max. Default is equal to
          the minimum when the control is created.
    
      - status : st                    (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the radio button's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the radio button from
          inside the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.                      Flag can have multiple
          arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - collection : cl                (unicode)       [create]
          To explicitly add a radio button to a collection of radio buttons specify the name of the radio collection.

      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editable : ed                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The edit state of the radio button.  By default, this flag is set to true and the radio button value may be changed by
          clicking on it.  If false then the radio button is 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the radio button
          can always be changed with the -sl/selectflag regardless of the state of the -ed/editableflag.
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's

          Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
    
      - recomputeSize : rs             (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size
          will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
    
      - select : sl                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Select the radio button.

      - visible : vis                  (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changedCommand : cc            (callable)      [create,edit]
          script to be executed when the range changes
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          returns the number of images
    
      - nextViewImage : nvi            (bool)          [create,edit]
          The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
          binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
          side. The nextViewImage flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal image storage mechanism to store to
          the next view location.
    
      - panel : pnl                    (unicode)       [create,query]
          Specifies the panel that the editor belongs to.  By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted
          panel it will belong to that panel.  If an editor doesn't belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it
          is in is deleted.
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query,edit]

          The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
          binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
          side. The resetViewImage flag tells the editor that it should reset its internal image storage mechanism to the first
          image. This would happen at the very start of a render view render.
    
      - saveImage : si                 (bool)          [edit]
          save the current Editor Image to memory. Saved Editor Images are stored in an Editor Image Stack. The most recently
          saved image is stored in position 0, the second most recently saved image in position 1, and so on... To set the current
          Editor Image to a previously saved image use the di/displayImageflag.
    
      - scaleBlue : sb                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
          Define the scaling factor for the blue component in the View. The default value is 1 and can be between -1000 to +1000

          Define the scaling factor for the red component in the View. The default value is 1 and can be between -1000 to +1000
    
      - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will synchronize with its own selection list.  As
          the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the change.
    
      - showRegion : srg               (int, int)      [create,query,edit]
          Shows the current region at the given resolution. The two parameters define the width and height.

          width, third is the height.
    
      - snapshotMode : snm             (bool)          []
    
      - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
          Query only flag.  Returns the MEL command that will edit an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
          command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
    
      - stereo : s                     (int)           [create,query,edit]
          Puts the editor into stereo image mode.  The effective resolution of the output image is twice the size of the
          horizontal size. The orientation of the images can be set using the stereoOrientation flag.
    
      - stereoImageOrientation : sio   (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the orientation of stereo camera renders.  The first argument specifies the orientation value for the
          firstleft image and the second argument specifies the orientation value for the right image. The orientation values are
          'normal', the image appears as seen throught he camera, or 'mirrored', the image is mirrored horizontally.
    
      - stereoMode : sm                (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies how the image is displayed in the view.  By default the stereo is rendered with a side by side image.  The
          rendered image is a single image that is twice the size of a normal image, 'both'. Users can also choose to display as
          'redcyan', 'redcyanlum', 'leftonly', 'rightonly', or 'stereo'.  both - displays both the left and right redcyan -
          displays the images as a red/cyan pair. redcyanlum - displays the luminance of the images as a red/cyan pair. leftonly -
          displays the left side only rightonly - displays the right side only stereo - mode that supports Crystal Eyes(tm) or
          Zscreen (tm) renders
    
      - toggle : tgl                   (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used with query.
    
      - unlockMainConnection : ulk     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic
          updates.
    
      - updateMainConnection : upd     (bool)          [create,edit]
          Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
    
      - useTemplate : ut               (unicode)       [create]
          Force the command to use a command template other than the current one.
    
      - viewImageCount : vic           (int)           [create,query,edit]
          The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image
          binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-
          side. The viewImageCount flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal image storage mechanism for a given
          number of views.
    
      - writeImage : wi                (unicode)       [edit]

def rowColumnLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a rowColumn layout. A rowColumn layout positions children in either a row or column format. A
    column layout, specified with the -nc/numberOfColumnsflag, allows you set text alignment, attachments and offsets for
    each column in the layout. Every member of a column will have the same alignment, attachment and offsets.  Likewise the
    row format, specified by the -nr/numberOfRowsflag, allows setting of these attributes for each row in the layout. Every
    member of a row will have the same attributes. The layout must be either a row or column format. This layout does not
    support both, or the specification of attributes on an individual child basis. Some flags only make sense for one of
    either the row format or the column format.  For example the -rh/rowHeightflag can only be specified in row format. In
    column format the row height is determined by the tallest child in the row, plus offsets.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - columnAlign : cal              (int, unicode)  [create,edit]
          Alignment for text and pixmaps in the specified column.  Values are: left, rightand center.  Only valid for column
          format, ie. number of columns specified with -nc/numberOfColumnsflag.
    
      - columnAttach : cat             (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
          The attachements and offsets for the children in the specified column.  The first argument is the 1-based column index.
          The second argument is the attachment, valid values are left, rightand both.  The third argument must be greater than 0
          and specifies the offset.
    
      - columnOffset : co              (int, unicode, int) [create,edit]
          The attachment offset for the specified column.  The first argument is the 1-based column index.  The second argument is
          the attachment, valid values are left, rightand both.  The third argument must be greater than 0 and specifies the
          offset.
    
      - columnSpacing : cs             (int, int)      [create,edit]
          The space between columns in pixels.  In column format this flag specifies that the space be to the left of the given
          column.  In row format it specifies the space between all columns, however a valid column index is still required.  The
          first argument is the 1-based column index.  The second argument must be greater than 0 and specifies the spacing.
    
      - columnWidth : cw               (int, int)      [create,edit]
          Width of a column. This flag is valid only in column format.  The column width must be greater than 0.  The first
          argument is the 1-based column index.  The second argument must be greater than 0 and specifies the column width.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return a string which is the value
          for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (ie. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should

          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of

def scrollLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a scroll layout.  A scroll layout is useful for when you have a number of controls which cannot all
    be visible at a time.  This layout will display a horizontal and/or vertical scroll bar when necessary to bring into
    view the hidden controls. Since the scroll layout provides no real positioning of children you should use another
    control layout as the immediate child.
    
    Flags:
      - annotation : ann               (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Annotate the control with an extra string value.
    
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,query,edit]
          The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each
          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - childArray : ca                (bool)          [query]
          Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
    
      - childResizable : cr            (bool)          [create,query]
          Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area.  You may also indicate a
          minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minimumChildWidthflag.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

      - horizontalScrollBarThickness : hst (int)           [create,edit]
          Thickness of the horizontal scroll bar.  Specify an integer value of pixels greater than or equal to 0. Other than
          setting the value to 0 to hide the scrollbar, this flag has no effect on Windows systems.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set

      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          position of the child. Positions increase from left to right within a row and then wrap around to the next row
          increasing from top to bottom. For example, a grid layout with 3 columns and 2 rows has 6 visible positions where 1, 2
          and 3 occupy the first row and 4, 5 and 6 occupy the second.                       Flag can have multiple arguments,
          passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - preventOverride : po           (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
    
      - width : w                      (int)           [create,query,edit]

          Set this widget up for sound scrubbing. Subsequent changes to current time will result in sound scrubbingbehavior, until
          the -endScrubcommand is issued for this widget.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

      - selectionConnection : slc      (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will synchronize with its own selection list.  As
          the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes
          changes, the editor updates to show the change.
    
      - showShapes : ss                (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If true, when transforms are selected their shapes will be displayed instead.
    
      - stateString : sts              (bool)          [query]
          Query only flag.  Returns the MEL command that will edit an editor to match the current editor state. The returned
          command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.

          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers

          component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless
          enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
    
      - changeCommand : cc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Command executed when the check box's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with
          onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the check box from inside
          the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the
          argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set
          as the current template.
    
      - disableOffImage : dfi          (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image displayed when the check box is off and disabled.
    
      - disableOnImage : dni           (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Image displayed when the check box is on and disabled.
    
      - docTag : dtg                   (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
          Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure like hierarchy. Eg. -dt
          render/multiLister/createNode/material
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and
          the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
    
      - enableBackground : ebg         (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          Enables the background color of the control.

          Image of the check box.
    
      - innerMargin : im               (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          This flag will revert the symbolCheckBox to its pre Maya 2.5 behaviour of having a 2 pixel inner margin. This flag is
          for backward compatibility on Linux only, and will be removed in future releases.                   Flag can have
          multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
    
      - isObscured : io                (bool)          [query]
          Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if
          it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's
          window is invisible or iconified.

def tabLayout(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command creates a tab group. Tab groups are a specialized form of control layouts that contain only control
    layouts. Whenever a control layout is added to a tab group it will have a tab provided for it that allows selection of
    that group from amongst other tabbed control groups. Only one child of a tab layout is visible at a time.

      - tabLabel : tl                  (unicode, unicode) [create,query,edit]
          Set a tab label.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second
          argument is the label for the tab associated with that child. If this flag is queried then the tab labels for all the
          children are returned.

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

    Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.textFieldButtonGrp`
    """

    pass


def textFieldGrp(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns starting at column 1.  The layout of each
    control (ie. column) can be customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach, -cal/columnAlign,
    and -adj/adjustableColumnflags.  By default, columns are left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide.  Only one
    column in any group can be adjustable. This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text and editable text
    field.  The label text is optional.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the

          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python

          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,

      - contextMenuCommand : cmc       (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Set the callback function to be invoked just before any attached context menu is shown. This can be used as a
          replacement to, or in addition to the postMenuCommand flag on the popupMenu command. The function should accept a string
          which will be the item that was clicked on (empty if no item was hit). The function should return true if the menu
          should be shown, false otherwise.
    
      - defineTemplate : dt            (unicode)       [create]
          Puts a command in a mode where any other flags and args are parsed and added to the command template specified in the

          as the current template.
    
      - displayLabel : dl              (unicode, unicode) [create,edit]
          Set a label for the item that is different than the string that identifies the item. This label will be used in the

      - dragAndDropCommand : dad       (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Sets the callback function to be invoked upon drag and drop of layers. the callback function should take as parameters:
          - a string array of the dropped items - a string array of the items previous parents - an integer array of the items
          previous indexes - a string for the item(s) new parent - an integer array for the item's new indexes - a string for the
          item that now comes before the dropped items - a string for the item that now comes after the dropped items
    
      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:
          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'
    
      - editLabelCommand : elc         (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Set the callback function to be invoked when the user changes the name of an item by double clicking it in the UI. The
          callback should accept two string arguments: the item name and the new name. The item name refers to the name of the
          item and not the display label. The callback function should return a string. An empty string indicates that the rename
          operation was invalid and the control should revert to the original name. If the rename operation is valid the callback
          should return a string that identifies the item, possibly different from the new display name entered by the user.
    
      - enable : en                    (bool)          [create,query,edit]

          The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is
          also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
    
      - visibleChangeCommand : vcc     (callable)      [create,query,edit]
          Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

      - dragCallback : dgc             (callable)      [create,edit]

          global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods) The proc returns a string array that
          is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.
          Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers
          CTL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTL, 3 == CTL + SHIFT. In Python, it is similar,
          but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the
          argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form: def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ): The
          values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in
          Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the
          standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, x, y,
          modifiers.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print
          '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'
    
      - dropCallback : dpc             (callable)      [create,edit]
          Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the
          callback is of the form: global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int
          $y, int $type) The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs
          array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback.
          $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link. In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify
          the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python
          callback should have the form: def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ): The values of
          these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above. The other way to specify the callback in Python is to
          specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard
          Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys dragControl, dropControl, messages,
          x, y, type.  The dragControlvalue is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be print

def window(*args, **kwargs):

    This command creates a new window but leaves it invisible. It is most efficient to add the window's elements and then
    make it visible with the showWindow command. The window can have an optional menu bar. Also, the title bar and
    minimize/maximize buttons can be turned on or off. If the title bar is off, then you cannot have minimize or maximize
    buttons. Note: The window will require a control layout of some kind to arrange the controls (buttons, sliders, fields,
    etc.).  Examples of control layouts are columnLayout, formLayout, rowLayout, etc. Note: This command will clear the
    uiTemplate stack.  Templates for a window need to be set after the window cmd.
    
    Flags:
      - backgroundColor : bgc          (float, float, float) [create,edit]
