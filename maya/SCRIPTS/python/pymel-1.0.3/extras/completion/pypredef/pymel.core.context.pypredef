    This is a context command to set the flags on the artAttrContext, which is the base context for attribute painting

          the tool name for the given context is returned. Note: due to the way MEL works, always specify the -query flag last

def artPuttyCtx(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This is a context command to set the flags on the artAttrContext, which is the base context for attribute painting
    operations. All commands require the name of the context as the last argument as this provides the name of the context
    to create, edit or query. This command is used to modify NURBS surfaces using a brush based interface (Maya Artisan).
    This is accomplished by moving the control vertices (cvs) under the brush in the specified direction. In query mode,
    return type is based on queried flag.
    
    Flags:

          mode, the name of the currently registered MEL command is returned and this will be an empty string if none is defined.

          upon the -timeChange value) will be moved an equivalent amount. When you overa key, the key is allowed to move to any
          time (as long as a key is not there already). When you segmentOvera set of keys (this option only has a noticeable
          effect when more than one key is being moved) the first key (in time) and last key define a segment (unless you specify
          a time range). That segment is then allowed to move over other keys, and keys will be moved to make room for the
          segment.                    Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

      - expandSelectionList : esl      (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If set, the selection lists will expand to have a single component in each item.  You probably want this as a default,
          otherwise two isoparms on the same surface will show up as 1 item.

          number of selection sets you have, the script can make use of variables string $Selection1[], $Selection2[], ...

          If set to true, together with -setAutoToggleSelection (see below) on the first selection set, causes the first selection
          after the computation of the previous result to be shiftselection, unless a modifier key is pressed.  Default is false.
          Flags for each selection set.  These flags are multi-use.

      - ignoreInvalidItems : iii       (bool)          [create,query,edit]
          If you have multiple selection sets, the state of the selection set is recorded at the time you complete it.  You could
          then delete some of the items in that list and end up with invalid items in one or more of your selection sets.  If this
          flag is set, those items will be detected and ignored.  You will never know it happened.  Its as if they were never
          selected in the first place, except that your selection set now does not have as many items as it may need.  If this
          flag is not set, you will get a warning and your final command callback script will likely not execute because of an
          error condition.

          the command.
    
      - setAutoToggleSelection : sat   (bool)          [create,edit]
          If set to true, it is as if shiftkey is pressed when there are no modifiers pressed.  That means that you get the toggle
          selectbehaviour by default.  This only applies to the 3D view, and the selection done in the hypergraph, outliner or
          elsewhere is still a subject to the usual rules.                    Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a

          If setAutoComplete is not set (see below) this string will be shown as soon as the tool has enough items for a
          particular selection set.  If this is not set, but is needed, the same string as set with -setSelectionPrompt flag will
          be used.

      - setSelectionCount : ssc        (int)           [create,edit]
          The number of items in this selection set.  0 means as many as you need until completion.
    
      - setSelectionHeadsUp : ssh      (unicode)       [create,edit]
          Supply a string that will be shown as a heads up prompt when there is something selected.  This must be set separately
          for each selection set.
    
      - setSelectionPrompt : ssp       (unicode)       [create,edit]
