"""
This module provides camera set support to the stereo camera
plug-in. Camera sets allow the users to break a single camera shot
into layers. Instead of drawing all objects with a single camera, you
can isolate the camera to only focus on certain objects and layer another
camera into the viewport that draws the other objects.  

For instance, a set of stereo parameters may make the background
objects divergent beyond the tolerable range of the human perceptual
system. However, you like the settings because the main focus is in
the foreground and the depth is important to the visual look of the
scene.  You can use camera sets to break apart the shot into a
foreground stereo camera and background stereo camera. The foreground
stereo camera will retain the original parameters; however, it will
only focus on the foreground elements.  The background stereo camera
will have a different set of stereo parameters and will only draw the
background element.
