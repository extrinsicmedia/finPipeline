def alignCurve(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    The curve align command is used to align curves in maya. The main alignment options are positional, tangent and
    curvature continuity. Curvature continuity implies tangent continuity. Positional continuity means the curves (move) or
    the ends of the curves (modify) are changed. Tangent continuity means one of the curves is modified to be tangent at the
    points where they meet. Curvature continuity means one of the curves is modified to be curvature continuous as well as
    tangent. The default behaviour, when no curves or flags are passed, is to only do positional and tangent continuity on
    the active list with the end of the first curve and the start of the other curve used for alignment.

    checkPoints flag sets the number of points per span at which the distance of the offset curve from the original curve is
    determined. The tolerance flag determines how accurately the offset curve should satisfy the required offset distance. A
    satisfactory offset curve is one for which all of the checkpoints are within the given tolerance of the required offset.

    there is no concept of argument ordering, so the items are returned in a dictionary keyed by the name of the flag.  In
    Python, if only one item is requested, then it will not be returned in a dictionary. For user convenience, if no flag is
    set, then all values are echoed. All flags (except -fmt/format) are in fact query-flags. For user convenience, the -q
    flag may be ommitted. Some comments for non-formatted output :3d bounding boxes are returned as 3 couples of floats, 2d
    ones as 2 couples of floats.if a bounding box is queried and cannot be computed (for example the component bounding box
    when no component is selected, or 2d bounding box for and unmapped object) 0 is returned for each array element, so that
    indices in the output array remain consistent.intvalues (queried by topological flags) cannot be mixed with floatvalues
    (queried by bounding box flags). Thus if no flag is set, only intvalues are returned.

def polyGeoSampler(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command performs a render sampling of surface color and transparency for each selected vertex or face and stores
    the sampled data as either the color value, or uses the sampled data to displace the affected vertices or faces by a
    sampled data value. Transparency is not used for displacement, and displacement is performed along vertex normals. The
    sampled data value used can be pre-scaled by a user defined amount. Additionally, the normals chosen for sampling can be
    overridden using a flatshading option. This option basically means to always use the normals of the faces when computing
    sampling values. This may be a desired if the user wishes to override an edge smoothness factor. Basically with the
    flatshading option on, edges are always considered to be hard. Note that displacement sampling will result in the
    -sampleByFace option to be turned off, since a displacement of a vertex always affects the faces the vertex is connected
    to. Finally, it is possible to force the storage of shared colors per vertex, and / or force the usage of unshared UV
    values. The computation of the resulting color is as follows: resulting-RGB = (sampled-RGB \* scale-factor);         if
    (color blend is none)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB         else if (color blend is add)

    geometry-RGB - sampled-RGB;         else if (color blend is multiply)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB \*
    sampled-RGB;         else if (color blend is divide)                 resulting-RGB = geometry-RGB / sampled-RGB;
    else if (color blend is average)                 resulting-RGB = (geometry-RGB \* 1/2) + (sampled-RGB \* 1/2);
    if (clamp option set)                 clamp resulting-RGB between minimum-RGB and maximum-RGB, The analogous computation
    is done for computing the resulting alpha value. The command requires that there be a camera selected in your scene in
    order to work properly in -batch or -prompt mode.

          Avoid regenerating triangles, by reusing the old triangles upstream in the construction history.  The construction
          history is searched upstream and downstream for other mesh nodes, and the given boolean value is set on those mesh
          nodes.  Note, that this command does not set the value on the given mesh node.  That has to be done using the setAttr
          command. This option would affect only the interactive 3d viewport. The batch-rendering would use the properly computed
          triangles. This is useful only for interactive performance such as skinning playback, when the display mode is shaded
          (or wireframe with triangles displayed)  Using this option for wireframe display mode is not recomended.

      - createUVs : cuv                (int)           [create]
          This flag alows a specific UV mechanism to be selected, while creating the primitive. The valid values are 0, 1,  2 or
          3. 0 implies that no UVs will be generated (No texture to be applied). 1 implies UVs should be created for the object as
          a whole without any normalization. The primitive will be unwrapped and then the texture will be applied without any
          distortion. In the unwrapped primitive, the shared edges will have shared UVs. 2 implies the UVs should be normalized.
          This will normalize the U and V direction separately, thereby resulting in distortion of textures. 4 implies UVs are
          created so that the texture will not be distorted when applied. The texture lying outside the UV range will be truncated
          (since that cannot be squeezed in, without distorting the texture. For better understanding of these options, you may

def polySplitVertex(*args, **kwargs):

    Use this command to split one or more vertices.A mesh is made up of one or more faces.  The faces are defined by edges
    which connect vertices together.  Typically a face will share vertices and edges with adjacent faces in the same mesh.
    Sharing vertices and edges helps reduce the amount of memory used by a mesh.  It also ensures that when a face is moved,
    all the connected faces move together.Sometimes you may want to separate a face from its connected faces so that it may
    be moved in isolation.  There are three ways to accomplish this depending upon which parts of the face you want to
    extract:polySplitVertexsplit one or more vertices so that each face that shared the vertex acquires its own copy of the
    vertexpolySplitEdgesplit one or more edges so that each face that shared the vertex acquires its own copy of the
    edgepolyChipOffcompletely extract the face so that it has its own vertices and edgesNotice that the area of affect of
    each operation is different.  polySplitVertex will affect all the edges and faces that shared the vertex.  This is the
    broadest effect.  polySplitEdge will only affect the faces which shared the edge and polyChipOff will affect a specific
    face.  If we just count vertices to measure the effect of each command when splitting all components of a face, starting
    from a 3x3 plane which has 16 vertices and we were to split the middle face:polySplitVertex applied to the four vertices
    would end up creating 12 new verticespolySplitEdge applied to the four edges would end up creating 4 new
    verticespolyChipOff applied to the middle face would end up creating 4 new verticesNote that polySplitVertex may create
    non-manifold geometry as a part of this operation. You can use Polygons-Cleanup afterwards to to clean up any non-

def roundConstantRadius(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    This command generates constant radius NURBS fillets and NURBS corner surfaces for matching edge pairs on NURBS
    surfaces.  An edge pair is a matching pair of surface isoparms or trim edges. This command can handle more than one edge
    pair at a time. This command can also handle compoundedges, which is where an edge pair is composed of more than two
    surfaces.  Use the -saand -sbflags in this case. The results from this command are three surface var groups plus the
    name of the new roundConstantRadius dependency node, if history was on. The 1st var group contains trimmed copies of the
    original surfaces.  The 2nd var group contains the new NURBS fillet surfaces.  The 3rd var group contains the new NURBS
    corners (if any). A simple example of an edge pair is an edge of a NURBS cube, where two faces of the cube meet.  This
    command generates a NURBS fillet at the edge and trims back the faces. Another example is a NURBS cylinder with a planar
    trim surface cap. This command will create a NURBS fillet where the cap meets the the cylinder and will trim back the
    cap and the cylinder. Another example involves all 12 edges of a NURBS cube.  NURBS fillets are created where any face
    meets another face.  NURBS corners are created whenever 3 edges meet at a corner.

    consisting of a number of Bezier patches or any isoparms with more than a single knot multiplicity, you could get into a
    situation where a tangent break occurs.  So, it only makes sense to do this operation on the knot isoparms, and not
    anywhere in between, because the surface is already smooth everywhere in between. If you have a cubic or higher degree
    surface, asking for the maximal smoothness will give you tangent, curvature, etc. up to the degree-1 continuity.  Asking
