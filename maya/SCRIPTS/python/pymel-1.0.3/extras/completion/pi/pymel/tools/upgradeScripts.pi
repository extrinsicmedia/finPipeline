This module provides functions for upgrading scripts from pymel 0.9 to 1.0.  It
fixes two types non-compatible code:
    - pymel.all is now the main entry-point for loading all pymel modules
        - import pymel         --> import pymel.all as pymel
        - import pymel as pm   --> import pymel.all as pm
        - from pymel import *  --> from pymel.all import *
    - pymel.mayahook.versions.Version is now pymel.versions

To use, run this in a script editor tab::

    import pymel.tools.upgradeScripts
    pymel.tools.upgradeScripts.upgrade()

This will print out all the modules that will be upgraded.  If everything looks good
run the following to perform the upgrade::

    pymel.tools.upgradeScripts.upgrade(test=False)

Once you're sure that the upgrade went smoothly, run::

    pymel.tools.upgradeScripts.cleanup()

This will delete the backup files.

If you need to undo the changes, run::

    pymel.tools.upgradeScripts.undo()

Keep in mind that this will restore files to their state at the time that you ran
``upgrade``.  If you made edits to the files after running ``upgrade`` they will
be lost.
