class Mel(object):
    """
    This class is a convenience for calling mel scripts from python, but if you are like me, you'll quickly find that it
    is a necessity. It allows mel scripts to be called as if they were python functions: it automatically formats python
    arguments into a command string which is executed via maya.mel.eval.  An instance of this class is already created for you
    when importing pymel and is called `mel`.
    
    
    
    default:
        >>> import maya.mel as mel
        >>> # create the proc
        >>> mel.eval( 'global proc myScript( string $stringArg, float $floatArray[] ){}')
        >>> # run the script
        >>> mel.eval( 'myScript("firstArg", {1.0, 2.0, 3.0})')
    
    pymel:
        >>> from pymel.all import *
        >>> # create the proc
        >>> mel.eval( 'global proc myScript( string $stringArg, float $floatArray[] ){}')
        >>> # run the script
        >>> mel.myScript("firstArg", [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    
    The above is a very simplistic example. The advantages of pymel.mel over maya.mel.eval are more readily
    apparent when we want to pass a python object to our mel procedure:
    
    default:
        >>> import maya.cmds as cmds
        >>> node = "lambert1"
        >>> color = cmds.getAttr( node + ".color" )[0]
        >>> mel.eval('myScript("%s",{%f,%f,%f})' % (cmds.nodeType(node), color[0], color[1], color[2])   )
    
    pymel:
        >>> from pymel.all import *
        >>> node = PyNode("lambert1")
        >>> mel.myScript( node.type(), node.color.get() )
    
    In this you can see how `pymel.core.mel` allows you to pass any python object directly to your mel script as if
    it were a python function, with no need for formatting arguments.  The resulting code is much more readable.
    
    Another advantage of this class over maya.mel.eval is its handling of mel errors.  If a mel procedure fails to
    execute, you will get the specific mel error message in the python traceback, and, if they are enabled, line numbers!
    
    For example, in the example below we redeclare the myScript procedure with a line that will result in an error:
    
        >>> commandEcho(lineNumbers=1)  # turn line numbers on
        >>> mel.eval( '''
        ... global proc myScript( string $stringArg, float $floatArray[] ){
        ...     float $donuts = `ls -type camera`;}
        ... ''')
        >>> mel.myScript( 'foo', [] )
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        MelConversionError: Error during execution of MEL script: line 2: ,Cannot convert data of type string[] to type float.,
        Calling Procedure: myScript, in Mel procedure entered interactively.
          myScript("foo",{})
    
    Notice that the error raised is a `MelConversionError`.  There are several MEL exceptions that may be raised,
    depending on the type of error encountered: `MelError`, `MelConversionError`, `MelArgumentError`, `MelSyntaxError`, and `MelUnknownProcedureError`.
    
    Here's an example showing a `MelArgumentError`, which also demonstrates the additional traceback
    information that is provided for you, including the file of the calling script.
    
        >>> mel.startsWith('bar') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
        MelArgumentError: Error during execution of MEL script: Line 1.18: ,Wrong number of arguments on call to startsWith.,
        Calling Procedure: startsWith, in file "..."
          startsWith("bar")
    
    Lastly, an example of `MelUnknownProcedureError`
    
        >>> mel.poop()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
        MelUnknownProcedureError: Error during execution of MEL script: line 1: ,Cannot find procedure "poop".,
    
    .. note:: To remain backward compatible with maya.cmds, all MEL exceptions inherit from `MelError`, which in turn inherits from `RuntimeError`.

          scriptJob and the selection change at the same time.
    
      - conditionChange : cc           (unicode, callable) [create]
          Run the script when the named condition changes state. The string must be the name of a pre-defined, or a user-defined
          boolean condition.  To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -listConditions flag.
    
      - conditionFalse : cf            (unicode, callable) [create]
          Run the script when the named condition becomes false. The string must be the name of a pre-defined, or a user-defined
          boolean condition.  To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -listConditions flag.
    
      - conditionTrue : ct             (unicode, callable) [create]
          Run the script when the named condition becomes true. The string must be the name of a pre-defined, or a user-defined
          boolean condition.  To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -listConditions flag.
    
      - connectionChange : con         (unicode, callable) [create]
          Run the script when the named attribute changes its connectivity.  The string must identify both the dependency node and
          the particular attribute.  If the dependency node is deleted, this job is killed (even if the deletion is undoable).
    
      - disregardIndex : dri           (bool)          [create]
          This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag.  If it is specified, and the job is
          attached to a multi (indexed) attribute, then the job will run no matter which attribute in the multi changes.
    
      - event : e                      (unicode, callable) [create]
          Run the script when the named event occurs.  This string must be the name of a pre-defined maya event.  To get a list of
          what events exist, use the -listEvents flag.
    
      - exists : ex                    (int)           [create]
          Returns true if a scriptJob with the specified job numberexists, and false otherwise. The job numbershould be a value
          that was returned on creation of a new scriptJob.
    
      - force : f                      (bool)          [create]
          This flag can only be used with -kill, -killAll, or -replacePrevious. It enables the deletion of protected jobs.
    
      - idleEvent : ie                 (callable)      [create]
          Run the script every time maya is idle.  WARNING, as long as an idle event is is registered, the application will keep
          calling it and will use up all available CPU time. Use idleEvents with caution.
    
      - kill : k                       (int)           [create]
          Kills the job with the specified job number. Permanent jobs cannot be killed, however, and protected jobs can only be
          killed if the -force flag is used in the command.
    
      - killAll : ka                   (bool)          [create]
          Kills all jobs. Permanent jobs will not be deleted, and protected jobs will only be deleted if the -force flag is used.
    
      - killWithScene : kws            (bool)          [create]
          Attaches the job to the current scene, and when the scene is emptied. The current scene is emptied by opening a new or
          existing scene.
    
      - listConditions : lc            (bool)          [create]
          This causes the command to return a string array containing the names of all existing conditions.  Below is the
          descriptions for all the existing conditions: Events Based on Available Maya FeaturesThese events are true when the
          given feature is available.Event NameMaya FeatureAnimationExistsAnimation AnimationUIExistsUser Interface for

      - listEvents : le                (bool)          [create]
          This causes the command to return a string array containing the names of all existing events.  Below is the descriptions
          for all the existing events:angularToleranceChanged:when the tolerance on angular units is changed. This tolerance can
          be changed by:using the MEL command, tolerancewith the -angularflagchanging the pref under Options-GeneralPreferences-

          item.Redo:when user has selected redo from the menu and there was something to redo.  This callback can be used for
          updating UI or local storage.  Do not change the state of the scene or DG during this callback.renderLayerChange:when
          creation or deletion of a render layer node has occured.renderLayerManagerChange:when the current render layer has

          callback can be used for updating UI or local storage.  Do not change the state of the scene or DG during this callback.
    
      - listJobs : lj                  (bool)          [create]
          This causes the command to return a string array containing a description of all existing jobs, along with their job
          numbers.  These numbers can be used to kill the jobs later.
    
      - nodeNameChanged : nnc          (unicode, callable) [create]
          Run the script when the name of the named node changes
    
      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create]
          Attaches this job to a piece of maya UI.  When the UI is destroyed, the job will be killed along with it.
    
      - permanent : per                (bool)          [create]
          Makes the job un-killable. Permanent jobs exist for the life of the application, or for the life of their parent object.
          The -killWithScene flag does apply to permanent jobs.
    
      - protected : pro                (bool)          [create]
          Makes the job harder to kill. Protected jobs must be killed or replaced intentionally by using the -force flag. The
          -killWithScene flag does apply to protected jobs.
    
      - replacePrevious : rp           (bool)          [create]
          This flag can only be used with the -parent flag.  Before the new scriptJob is created, any existing scriptJobs that
          have the same parent are first deleted.
    
      - runOnce : ro                   (bool)          [create]
          If this is set to true, the script will only be run a single time.  If false (the default) the script will run every
          time the triggering condition/event occurs.  If the -uid flag is used, runOnce is turned on automatically.
    
      - timeChange : tc                (callable)      [create]
          Run the script whenever the current time changes. The script will not be executed if the time is changed by clicking on
          the time slider, whereas scripts triggered by the timeChangedcondition will be executed.
    
      - uiDeleted : uid                (unicode, callable) [create]
          Run the script when the named piece of UI is deleted.
